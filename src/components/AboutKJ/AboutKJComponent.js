                <p>
                    “To whom much is given much is required” Luke 12:48 I have been blessed to work for so many amazing families.
                    I have been able to travel with my clients and be able to take time from work to support and be with my own family.
                    The friendships that I have made over the years will last a lifetime because I value and cherish those I worked with.
                    I have been in the health care field my entire life. It started when I was a little girl.
                    I always helped my family with their wounds, wheelchairs, administering CPR, and delivering children.
                    One of my proudest accomplishments was caring for my grandmother Maggie who raised me until she passed.
                    My eclectic experiences truly made me a well rounded and adaptable.
                    I have worked in the health field at the collegiate level serving students at Salem College.
                    I served Veterans at the VA Hospitals in Durham and in West Palm Beach.
                    I worked as a Victim Advocate with Family Services.
                    Most recently I worked as a Teaching Assistant in the W-S Forsyth County School System in Title I schools with children.
                    I have worked in various setting including hospitals, nursing homes, and patient homes.
                    Venturing to unfamiliar realms I served customers within a financial institution setting
                    as a financial service representative and back-up support.
                    I have worked in critical care units, pediatrics, dermatology, neurology, cardiology, orthopedics,
                    general medicine and surgery.
                    Unbenounced to me I would always found myself back in the helping profession this is where I belong.
